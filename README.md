Bubble Sort

Bubble sort sorts through a collection of data by comparing two values and swapping out if need be.  With each comparison, the smaller number is swapped with the larger number towards the begining of the array.  The larger number continues to the end of the array.  This process continues until array is in order from least to greatest.

Merge Sort

Continuously divides the array length in half until two numbers remain to compare which is lower.  The lower number is pushed into an array.  The remaining numbers continue comparing, the smaller number is pushed into the array until the last (largest) number remains.

Quick Sort








TEST
1.  Import 5 functions from 5 javascript src files
2.  For each sorting function run and test several arrays
3.  Stub out each sorting function's source file, exporting a bare function
4.  Describe each sorting algorithm at the top of the source files.
  - how it works
  - what happens in each step
