Bubble Sort

Bubble sort sorts through a collection of data by comparing two values and swapping out if need be.  With each comparison, the smaller number is swapped with the larger number towards the begining of the array.  The larger number continues to the end of the array.  This process continues until array is in order from least to greatest.



~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Merge Sort

Continuously divide the array length in half until one number remains on the left side and one on the right.  When one number remains, compare the two numbers, the lower number goes to the left, remerge the array.  Continue to compare the left and right side of the divided array while remerging the array.

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Insertion Sort

Compares an current integer to previous integer.  If the previous integer is larger then the current integer continues down the array until previous integer is smaller than current integer.  Insert it current integer in that index.

Quick Sort








TEST
1.  Import 5 functions from 5 javascript src files
2.  For each sorting function run and test several arrays
3.  Stub out each sorting function's source file, exporting a bare function
4.  Describe each sorting algorithm at the top of the source files.
  - how it works
  - what happens in each step
